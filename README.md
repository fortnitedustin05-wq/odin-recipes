# odin-recipes

This project requires the creation of a very basic web page that displays a recipe in the browser. For now it will consist of html only.

It will demonstrate knowledge of basic HTML tags, the ability to create a git repo, the ability to stage and push changes to the repo in GitHub, the ability to create an index.html file, the ability to lay that file out properly, and finally the ability to create and document the file in a README.md.
